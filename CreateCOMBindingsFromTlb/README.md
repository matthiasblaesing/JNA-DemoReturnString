This sample shows how to bind a COM libary, for which a TLB file is present.

The binding is based on TlbCodeGenerator[1] and relies on the binding for stdole
already being present [2]. To install the stdole bindings, it should be enough
to run `mvn install` from within the stdole2 directory.

For the sample: The TLB file in `src/main/tlb/COMIUnknownTest.TLB` is the base
for the bindings. The file is parsed and the resulting java binding is generated
into the directories `src/main/java` and `src/main/resources`. The bindings are
generated by running:

```shell
mvn eu.doppel-helix.jna.tlbcodegenerator:TlbCodeGenerator:generate
```

The bindings can now be adjusted or directly build

```shell
mvn install
```

Please note: The `generate` task can only be run on windows, as it relies on
the OS for parsing the tlb file.
